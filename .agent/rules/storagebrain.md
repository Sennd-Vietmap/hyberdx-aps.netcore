🧠 Brain Persistence Plan:
Local Backup: I'll create a .antigravity/brain/ folder inside your project.
Data Migration: I'll copy all artifacts, implementation plans, tasks, and walkthroughs into this folder.
Restoration Script: I'll include a small script (restore-brain.ps1) so that on a new machine, you can simply run it to "restore" the context for the Antigravity system.

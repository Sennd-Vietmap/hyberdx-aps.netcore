# Phase 3: Reliability Engineering

This plan outlines the implementation of reliability strategies using ClickStack, focusing on measuring and maintaining service quality.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> Reliability engineering is as much about process as it is about tools. We will provide the technical configuration, but you will need to define the business thresholds.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. SLO/SLI Definitions

#### [NEW] [RELIABILITY_GUIDE.md](file:///d:/study/google-antigravity/clickstack-aspnet/RELIABILITY_GUIDE.md)
A comprehensive guide defining:
- **SLIs (Indicators)**: Latency (P99 < 500ms), Availability (Success Rate > 99.5%).
- **SLOs (Objectives)**: The target percentage for these indicators over a rolling window (e.g., 30 days).
- **Error Budgets**: How to track "allowable" downtime.

### 2. Automated Alerting

#### [MODIFY] [otel-collector-config.yaml](file:///d:/study/google-antigravity/clickstack-aspnet/otel-collector-config.yaml)
Add a sample `alerting` processor or exporter configuration (if supported by the contrib collector) or guide the user on using the HyperDX UI Alerting engine.

### 3. Log Pattern Recognition

#### [MODIFY] [RELIABILITY_GUIDE.md](file:///d:/study/google-antigravity/clickstack-aspnet/RELIABILITY_GUIDE.md)
Add instructions on how to use HyperDX's "Log Patterns" feature to identify and group recurring errors automatically.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None.

### Manual Verification
1. **Dashboard Review**: Create a sample "Reliability Dashboard" in HyperDX using the SQL queries from the previous phase.
2. **Alert Test**: Manually trigger an error (via the Traffic Generator) and verify that the defined SLI reflects the degradation immediately.
